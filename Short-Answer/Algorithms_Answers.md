Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

1.

this code is saying while i\*n^2 < n^3, meaning it'll run n times, n^1

2.

this code has 4 nested loops the length of n and adding 1 as it goes into the next loop, n^4

3.

if the input is, 0, -1 or and odd negative number, it will return 0 eventually, else if will loop eventually. so if n<-1, runtime is n/2
