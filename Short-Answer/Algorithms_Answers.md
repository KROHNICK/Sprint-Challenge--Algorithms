Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Part 1

1.

this code is saying while i\*n^2 < n^3, meaning it'll run n times, n^1

2.

this code has 4 nested loops the length of n but the 4th is a constant, so n^3

3.

itirates n times for depending on the input, so n

Part 2

Search for the half point of n stories, if egg doesnt breaks, too low, and search higher half, if egg breaks, search lower half because too high. Repeatedly until you find the f floor.

O(log(n)) - binary search
