# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I

Give an analysis of the running time of each snippet of
pseudocode with respect to the input size n of each of the following:

```
a)  a = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):
      a = a + n * n
```

this code is saying while i\*n^2 < n^3, meaning it'll run n times, n^1

```
b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      i += 1
      for j in range(i + 1, n):
        j += 1
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
          k += 1
          for l in range(k + 1, 10 + k):
            l += 1
            sum += 1
```

this code has 4 nested loops the length of n and adding 1 as it goes into the next loop, n^4

```
c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
```

if the input is, 0, -1 or and odd negative number, it will return 0 eventually, else if will loop eventually. so if n<-1, runtime is n/2

## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an _n_-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor _f_ or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor _f_. Devise a strategy to determine the value of _f_ such that the number of dropped eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode and give the runtime complexity of your solution.
